Webpack typescript Graphql server start kit that grew out of a need for a project i am working on

Useful commands:
----
    npm run build       - build the library files (Required for start:watch)
    npm run build:watch - build the library files in watchmode (Useful for development)
    npm start           - Start the server
    npm run dev         - Start the server in watchmode (Useful for development)
    npm test            - run tests once
    npm run test:watch  - run tests in watchmode (Useful for development)
    npm run gqlToTs     - builds out typescript types from your graphql types and puts them in src/types
How to run it:
----
```bash
    yarn install --ignore-scripts
    ## development mode
    npm run dev
    ## production
    npm run build & npm start
```

Development GuideLines

Typescript requires types for external dependency. When you install a new run time dependency endevour to install types for it.
```
// eg
$ yarn add --dev @types/fs-extra
```

TODO

- [ ] add more guidlines
- [ ] publisht to yeoman and neutrino
- [ ] possibly move some of the library code into a separate npm package
